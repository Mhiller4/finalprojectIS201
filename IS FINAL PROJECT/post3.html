                            Another week has passed in the MTC, and let me tell ya. This week was the fastest, most
                            packed, and best week so far. I'll break down how this week started.</h3>

                    <p> I'll break down how this week started. On monday morning Kiana and I were working out in the
                        morning together when bam. FULL RAINBOW was across the sky, if that doesn't tell you how the
                        week is about to go I don't know what will! But here in Texas we've had rain almost every day. A
                        definite highlight of the week was when it was crazy stormy and my Dog was scared. Oakley (my
                        dog) came and jumped into my arms, in the middle of a MTC lesson!! She sat and the camera cut
                        her off so I don't think anyone saw her, but it was awesome! <br><br> She put her face on my
                        notebook so
                        I did not get that many notes out of that class haha!

                        This week started our first week in French Immersion! So starting Tuesday we've been taught
                        fully in French! Which is crazy. <br><br> We answer in French and are taught French grammar, but
                        in
                        French! <br><br> The rate we learn french in the MTC is incredible, I truly believe I have
                        already
                        surpassed my two years of Spanish. </p>



                    <h2 class="section-heading">Teaching Others Appointments</h2>
                    <p> Elder Smith and I had a great chance to teach and hold a discussion for the first time in French
                        yesterday. These are called a "Helping Others Activity" or a TRC. They're essentially
                        opportunities we have to meet with others and share messages of hope and joy with them!
                        <br><br>
                        The French one went so well!! Of course there were things I couldn't understand from her, and
                        there were some things Elder Smith and I couldn't communicate. However the discussion went
                        really well, and I think we all came out of it feeling uplifted and more optimistic.
                        <br><br>

                        I was so lucky, some of her favorite hobbies were repelling and being in the mountains, so I was
                        able to connect with her in French because I knew those words. And I am grateful Elder Smith and
                        I planned out things together so we never had any awkward places.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Spiritual Thought</h2>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">
                        <p>
                            So my subject line is "Dieu est dans les détails" which means God is in the Details. God is
                            in the details of your life. I had a cool experience this week in understanding that God
                            cares for each of us. <br><br> I found myself getting frustrated about a lot of things I
                            couldn't
                            control. Passports,visa delays, the language, time, etc.




                            I talked with my instructor about some of these concerns and she gave me this amazing
                            insight "God's plan for us is way better than any plan we have for ourselves. " <br><br>
                            I felt so reassured with that, and the next day so many of these concerns and insecurities
                            got solved! God cares so much about the welfare of his children. <br><br> And while there
                            are a lot
                            of things we cannot control or we don't know why they happen to us, I know God is in our
                            corner and wants what is best for us. <br><br>

                            His plan for each of us is going to be so much more fulfilling, edifying, and promising than
                            we can imagine. <br><br>Yes there is hardship, yes life is hard, but the way we go through
                            life
                            doesn't have to be.
                            <br><br>
                            Conflict is inevitable but contention is a choice.
