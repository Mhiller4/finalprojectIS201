                    <p> Okay, okay Guys, super super cool fact

                        Tahitians and Most Polynesians beat Einstein to one of his Philosophy, Einstein had this idea
                        that Time moves relative to an observer. Meaning we can only see the past and we move backwards
                        through time. Go check it out, it is a really cool theory. Essentially we only see the past and
                        can't see the future.

                        Now! In Tahitian "I mu'a" means the past and "i muri" means the future. <br> Now also those same
                        words mean in front, and behind in Tahitian. Leading to a basic motto of, "You cannot predict
                        the future, but you can 1000% read the past, so learn from the past to prepare for the future".

                        Tahitian was around way before Einstein. <br><br>So yeah, Tahitians beat Albert Einstein. Boom.

                        <br><br><br>
                        I hope that makes sense! Couple of updates on my side.

                        I have completed week two of MTC! It's been so good. Elder Smith (my companion) and I have been
                        hard at work with everything. We had the great opportunity to teach two discussions this week.
                        They both went pretty well and we learned a lot. <br><br> I am so lucky to have such an amazing
                        companion. He pushes me to be the best missionary I can be. For those curious about our 30 words
                        a day challenge, It has been going well!! It definitely stretches us and has kept companion
                        studies going well!


                        <br><br> I am doing well and I am loving the mission work and it is so so awesome
                    </p>



                    <h2 class="section-heading">WORD OF THE WEEK</h2>
                    <p> Favorite word of this week: <br>

                        Tahitian: Utuafare muri ore 
                        <br>
                        Family without end : Eternal Family
                        <br>
                        French: abracadabrantesque: abracadabra 
                        <br>
                        Shoutout: Cade Uluave rumor has it you returned a 99 yard kick off for a touchdown. Great job!! Supa proud of you toko!

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Spiritual Thought</h2>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">
                        <p> God puts people into our lives for a reason. I've been thinking a lot about all the wonderful people who have helped me along my path to where I am. <br><br> I love the verse in 1 Nephi 9 : 6! Some context for y'all this is Nephi a Prophet in the Book of Mormon and his thoughts on God doing things we don't always understand. <br><br>

                            1 Nephi 9:6 "But the Lord knoweth all things from the beginning; wherefore, he prepareth a way to accomplish all his works among the children of men; for behold, he hath all power unto the fulfilling of all his words. And thus it is" 
                            
                            So this teaches a really important concept. <br><br> God knows each and every one of us. There is a reason for all things, every friend, family, or individual that has come into your life is there for a reason. Good or bad.
